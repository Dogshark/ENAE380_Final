Stats
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[hull]: A measure of your ship's physical durability. If your hull is reduced to 0, your
	ship is destroyed.

	fighting enemy ships, any damage taken will reduce your shields, only damaging your 
	hull once the shields are depleted. 

[Weapons]: A measure of your ship's offensive combat systems. A higher weapons stat will 
	improve your ships ability to hit targets, and increase the damage dealt.

[Power]: A measure of your ship's power production. An increased power stat provides minor 
	improvements to shield strength, weapons capabilities, and ship speed.

[Speed]: A measure of your ship's engine power. Higher speed allows your ships to escape
	enemies more easily.
